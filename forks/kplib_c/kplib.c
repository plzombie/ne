Features of KPLIB.C:
	* Routines for decoding JPG/PNG/GIF/PCX/TGA/BMP/DDS/CEL.
		See kpgetdim(), kprender(), and optional helper function: kpzload().
	* Routines for reading files out of ZIP/GRP files. All ZIP/GRP functions start with "kz".
	* Multi-platform support: Dos/Windows/Linux/Mac/etc..
	* Compact code, all in a single source file. Yeah, bad design on my part... but makes life
		  easier for everyone else - you simply add a single C file to your project, throw a few
		  externs in there, add the function calls, and you're done!

I offer this code to the community for free use - all I ask is that my name be included in the
credits.
